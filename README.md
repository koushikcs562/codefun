# CodeFun: Learn Coding the Fun Way!

CodeFun is a web application designed to make learning to code engaging and enjoyable for school children. We achieve this through interactive games and brain-teasing puzzles integrated into each level.

## How it Works

CodeFun presents coding concepts in a playful manner. As students progress through the levels, they solve puzzles and play games that reinforce their understanding of programming fundamentals.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React JS - For a dynamic and interactive user experience.
* **Backend:** Node.js - To handle server-side logic and APIs.
* **Database:** Firebase - For real-time data storage and management.

## Target Audience
